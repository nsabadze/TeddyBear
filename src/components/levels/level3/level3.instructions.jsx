  <p>You are in the office. How about writing a report of what has been done today? Click on the computer.</p>,
  <p>In the left you can see a report form which must be filled. After clicking on apply button the data from this form should appear in the right document.</p>,
  <p>Unfortunately the functionality is broken now. Only information from name field and cooking checkbox is sent to the document.</p>,
  <p>You should add some logic to src/quiz/level3.js file in order to repaire it. Use the implementation of working fields as an example. You can also find some useful comments inside the file.</p>,
  <p>You should create references to all the fields, hang them on input tags and finish writing logic inside applyFormData function.</p>,
  <p>Before sending the phone value to the document add a code '+375' before it inside applyFormData function.</p>,
  <p>After finishing the logic, fill the form with correct data and click on apply button.</p>
